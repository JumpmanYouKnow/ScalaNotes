# ScalaNotes
I wrote more than 5000 lines of scala code about 1 year ago, but later on I don't have any chance to write it. (Univeristy doesn't teach it, previous internships don't use it, what a pity, such a beautiful language)

Now I'm picking it up as the University teaches spark by scala, but I feel that I forgot lots of not only syntax but also some key knowledge about scala.

Therefore I want to open this repo as my scala notes.
